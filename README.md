# TODOs
- host the demo somewhere with less interference
- add a better metric like FID for tracking dmd progress
- add EMAs to the training
- add flash or flex attention 
- bigger dataset
- clean up the repo

# DONE

- inference with kv-caching
- hook it up to the interactive demo
- config management / export
- there seems to be a problem at initialization, the loss is somewhat proportional to the number of residual layers
